  <p>
    I'm a technocrat - when I work on a problem, my first instinct is to try and apply a high-tech solution.
    And while bike theft is a relatively low-tech crime with
     low-tech solutions (bigger locks! better parking!)
    there are always new technologies whose potential for fighting bike theft get me excited.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this section, I look at some of the products I think can help fight bike theft -
    this can run the gamut: locks, GPS trackers, identity markers, even online services for finding stolen bikes,
    or other asset tracking technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm always looking for new products to demo, though! Do you have a product you would like me to examine?

  <h3 class='lead list-title'>Identidots - cheap, easily applied microtags in a hardened adhesive</h3>
  <a href="identidots.php"><img src="/images/articles/identidots_small.jpg" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5></a>
  I take a look at <b>Identidots</b>, a microtag-based marking technology that lets you mark items
  with small 'microtags' in a UV-active hardened adhesive. One of the very, very few options out there for
  marking components! Do it yourself asset marking with some nice side benefits: unobtrusive application,
  near-invisible to the naked eye when applied, UV active, comes with traditional asset tags as well.<p>

  <b>Pros:</b> inexpensive, easily concealed and applied, a great solution for component marking
  <b>Cons:</b> microtag readers aren't readily available to the public or police yet.

  <h3 class='lead list-title'>Spybike - stem-hidden GPS tracker with SMS alerting</h3>
  <a target=_new href="http://fahrrad-diebstahl.com/?sPartner=stolenbicycleregistry.com"><img

  I'm still waiting to get my hands on a <a target=_new
    href="http://fahrrad-diebstahl.com/?sPartner=stolenbicycleregistry.com">SpyBike 'Topcap' GPS tracker</a>,
    but this stem-hidden GPS tracking device is <b>the</b> one product I've been dying to get my hands on.
    Despite being kind of pricy (150-euro, which is ~$200 USD) the SpyBike TopCap's combination of camouflage, active GPS
    tracking, and SMS/text/mobile-alerting has some amazing
    potential for fighting bike theft. As always, though, the devil is in the details, so I've been dying to try one out.
    <p>In the meantime, you can
    learn more about the SpyBike TopCap at
  <a target=_new href="http://fahrrad-diebstahl.com/?sPartner=stolenbicycleregistry.com">fahrrad-diebstahl.com</a>
  - just flip their website from German to English
  in the upper righthand corner of the website.
  <p>
    You may remember the <a target=_new href="http://fahrrad-diebstahl.com/?sPartner=stolenbicycleregistry.com">fahrrad-diebstahl</a>
    name from last year, when they introduced their "<a target=_new href="http://www.integratedtrackers.com/GPSTrack/spylamp2.jsp">SpyLamp</a>" GPS-in-a-bikelight product, which also gained lots and lots
    of press and had me praising their mix of active tracking tech and active GPS tracking. Also? "fahrrad diebstahl", for
    those of you that are wondering, translates roughly to "bicycle theft".

  <p>

  <b>Pros:</b> nicely hidden GPS tracking unit
  <b>Cons:</b> pricy

  <h3 class='lead list-title'>betterworldclub.com's bicycle accident and liability insurance</h3>

  While admittedly this is not a <b>tech</b>-related item, bicycle insurance
  is something I've been keeping an eye on as more and more agencies realize there is a growing market.
    <a target=_new href="http://www.betterworldclub.com/home.htm?join_code=BHAN2121">Betterworldclub.com</a>
    is a Portland OR based 'environmentally friendly auto club', and offers bicycle accident
    and liability insurance. <p>

    Taken from <a target=_new href="http://www.betterworldclub.com/home.htm?join_code=BHAN2121">betterworldclub.com</a>:
    <blockquote>
    <i>When former Working Assets Mutual Fund President Mitch Rofsky learned that AAA
      actually lobbies against environmental efforts like higher fuel economy standards
      and alternative transportation, he founded Better World Club, the nation's only
      environmentally friendly auto club. Better World Club provides carbon offsets
      for travel, gives discounts to hybrid auto drivers, surcharges gas-guzzlers,
      and dedicates one percent of its gross revenues to environmental cleanup and
      advocacy. Better World Club also offers an option for <b>bicycle roadside protection</b>
      and gives family membership status to domestic partners as well as married couples.

  <p>I'll be reviewing this and other bike insurance options a little closer in the future.
